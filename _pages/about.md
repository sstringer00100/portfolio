I swapped a graduate career in history for the growing field of data analytics. Now I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics and I’ve been putting that degree to work solving real business problems in areas such as operations, marketing, and finance. Through my education and professional experince I've developed a strong background in laguages including Python, R, SAS, and SQL.
