Thank you again for taking the time to view my Data Science Portfolio. I've had a long journey to the data science world and I'm glad to have the opportunity to share with you projects that I've developed along the way.  

I’ve always had a love for learning and an eagerness to solve problems. After finishing my first master's degree in Classics, I came to realize that an academic career in the humanities was not something that would satisfy that love and eagerness in the right way for me. All throughout grad school I worked a corporate job that I had almost disregarded as a passing gig until I could leave the office grind behind and set off for a highly coveted PhD in Classics. Teaching seemed like a good fit for me, or at least I wanted it to fit me. But what I really enjoyed most was challenging studies and an environment where I could always be stretched intellectually. It was in that mundane office environment that I was lured away from the academic life and enticed to solve the real-world problems faced every day in private industry.  

I swapped Classics for the study of big data, statistics, and business. Now I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics and I’ve been putting that degree to work solving real business problems in areas such as operations, marketing, and financial services. The projects I showcase here help give you as a reader an insight into what I’ve had the opportunity to work on and examples of many of the fun tools out there for data scientists. My hope is that you find something I post on this site helpful, insightful, or at the very least enjoyable. Feel free to use anything I publish on here. If you want to connect, please reach out to me on LinkedIn and I’ll be happy to respond. 

Enjoy the site!
