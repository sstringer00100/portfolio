#### My name is Steven and Iâ€™m a data scientist from North Texas.

I'm a data analyst and data scientist currently working as Senior Credit Risk Analyst in personal lending in the Dallas area. As a graduate from the University of Dallas with a Master of Science in Business Analytics, I've had the opportunity to contribute to analytics teams at large corporations such as Southwest Airlines and GM Financial. I'm proficient in languages including Python, R, SAS, and SQL. I also specialize in creating automated reporting and model development to improve customer experiences and expand business markets. My goal is to use analytics to provide real-world solutions to an ever-changing and always complex world. When I'm not delving into data or toying around with a new model, I'm geeking out to history most people probably slept through in class.
