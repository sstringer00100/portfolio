# My Data Science Portfolio Using minimalmistakes Theme 

## Portfolio Site

I don't have a background in web development so I searched around for a simple theme that I could use to build a more visually appealing portfolio. I stumbled upon the minimalmistakes theme which uses Jekyll and can be easily hosted on Github Pages for free. The theme is very simple to edit and use, but doesn't sacrifice features or looks for the sake of ease. The projects appear in the form of blog posts using markdown language. Everything from code to images are stored in this repo.  

Check out the [minimalmistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) to start your own site.
