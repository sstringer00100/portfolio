# My Data Science Portfolio Using minimalmistakes Theme 

## Portfolio Site

I don't have a background in web development so I searched around for a simple theme that I could use to build a more visually appealing portfolio. 

Check out the [minimalmistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) to start your own site.
